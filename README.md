# QSET_BUCK_CONV
Buck Converter which can have an input votlage of 12V-9V and then step-down the voltage to 5V. There is also an E-Fuse on the output of the Buck converter for extra safety.

Inside the folder there are 3 more folder.
1 - One folder that all the EAGLE library files needed to see the schematic

2 - One folder holds the EAGLE schematic and PCB files

3 - One folder has the TinaTi, spice files used to test the buck converter before manufcaturing the PCB. TinaTi is a spice software that TI offers for their components,
it helped check that the Buck converter transient response and how bad its Output Voltage ripple would be under various loads.
